# Pytorch implementation of (attention-based)Seq2seq prediction of time series
This is an implementation of [Seq2seq prediction of spatiotemporal system](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5133405)
paper using the Pytorch-based framework [Learner](https://github.com/jpzxshi/learner). 

To run the example of lorenz system:
```
python example_lorenz.py
```

Besides the seq2seq models, I also implemented baseline methods including LSTM and [Multistep Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01236).
